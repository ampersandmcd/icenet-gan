# icenet-gan
Welcome to `icenet-gan`, an experimental extension of the [IceNet](https://icenet.ai/) project led by the [British Antarctic Survey](https://bas.ac.uk/).

## Purpose

`icenet-gan` is extension to the IceNet project using GANs to produce sharper sea ice forecasts.

## Structure

- `src`: Contains the core data downloading and preprocessing code, along with model architecture definitions and training scripts.
- `notebooks`: Contains five notebooks providing a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire project. If you're new to the project, we recommend you start here!
